# GS Automated Installation of tools for Ubuntu/Debian Based Systems

**I don't see why this would work for you, but if it's useful for you glad to have assisted!**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Works with:

		- Pretty much anything debian based, for now.
		- Includes a bunch of stuff you probably would never use, but I do. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	System Hardening:

		- It would improve the security of: fail2ban, dchp, SSH, telnet, http.

>> Includes a modified conf file for fail2ban and SSH that really does decrease the amount of noise in the logs. 
>> We got some NordVPN & Spotify as well.
>> Nameservers from NordVPN, Google & CloudFare.
>> PARANOID feature from SSHD is activated for all incoming traffic. (If you need people to connect to you, better change)
